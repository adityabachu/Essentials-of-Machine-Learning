This repo consists of basics of machine learning 
In this repo we cover some essential python libraries like.

1)Numpy

2)Pandas 

3)Matplotlib 

4)Seaborn 

5)Scikit learn

 -> Applying and evaluating supervised machine learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks
 
 -> Applying and evaluating unsupervised learning algorithms for clustering tasks.
 
 -> Understanding the Bayesian and Ensemble learning, applying and evaluating different type of these algorithms for better prediction.
 
 -> Understanding and designing Artificial Neural Networks computational model
